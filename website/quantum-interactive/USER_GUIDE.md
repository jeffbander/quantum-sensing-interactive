# Quantum Sensing Interactive Visualization Tool - User Guide

## Overview

The Quantum Sensing Interactive Visualization Tool is an educational web application that demonstrates the fundamental differences between quantum sensing and traditional sensing technologies through interactive 3D visualizations.

## Features

### 1. Quantum Particle Simulator

This interactive 3D simulation demonstrates quantum superposition and how it enables quantum sensors to detect signals in ways classical sensors cannot. You can:

- Manipulate quantum states in real-time
- Toggle between classical and quantum views
- Observe how quantum particles behave differently from classical particles

### 2. Noise Floor Simulator

This visualization shows how quantum sensors can detect signals below the thermal noise floor that fundamentally limits classical sensors. You can:

- Adjust signal strength to see when it becomes undetectable by classical sensors
- Modify noise levels to understand detection thresholds
- Compare quantum vs. classical detection capabilities

### 3. Medical Application Simulator

This comprehensive 3D simulation demonstrates three medical applications where quantum sensing provides capabilities impossible with classical approaches:

- Brain monitoring (magnetoencephalography)
- Heart monitoring (magnetocardiography)
- Peripheral nerve monitoring

For each application, you can:
- Switch between different biological systems
- Toggle between classical and quantum sensors
- Adjust signal strength
- Run simulations to see real-time detection results
- Observe 3D models with animated signal propagation

## Navigation

- Use the navigation menu at the top to move between different sections
- The scroll-to-top button appears when you scroll down for easy navigation
- All interactive elements have tooltips explaining their function

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- For optimal experience: desktop or tablet device
- Mobile devices are supported but may have reduced performance for 3D visualizations

## Educational Value

This tool is designed to help users understand:
- Why quantum sensing represents a fundamental paradigm shift rather than just an incremental improvement
- The physical principles that enable quantum sensors to outperform classical sensors
- Specific medical applications where quantum sensing enables previously impossible measurements
- How quantum technologies are already being applied in healthcare today
